            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>i graduated 3yrs ago with as Actuarial Science degree.
                i joined Mwalimu Sacco immediately after degree as an 
                intern. my main role was to analyse client accounts 
                and asses his/her loan repayment capacity. Six months 
                later, i got emloyed at Britam insurance company as 
                assistance staff at claims department.</p>
            <p>As i was at Britam, I developed interest in IT. I did a 
                research on the colleges offering the course, considering
                factors like location, fees and time duration to graduate. 
                These are the main factors that contributed to my decision
                on joining moringa school.
